In this program, Duke\u2019s NY alumni can provide guidance and advice to the most recent Duke graduates via a 1:1 mentorship program. The goal is for the mentorship to be six months and involve at least four casual conversations (phone, Zoom, in-person). The main goal of the program is to welcome students to the NY area and be a sounding board to any questions or concerns.<br><br>If you are interested in being a mentor, please fill out this survey which should take less than ~5 minutes.
